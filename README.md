# Image Bit Depth and Resolution Manipulation

This project demonstrates how to modify the bit depth and resolution of an image using Python. The script generates images with different bit depths and resolutions to show how these parameters impact the appearance of the image.

## Overview

The script performs two main tasks:

1. **Change the Bit Depth**: Reduces the bit depth of the image, which affects the color representation by limiting the number of possible values for each pixel channel.
   
2. **Change the Resolution**: Resizes the image to different resolutions (scales), simulating the effects of downscaling and then upscaling.

These manipulations are done for several combinations of bit depths and scales, and the resulting images are displayed for comparison.
